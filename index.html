    <article id="bio" class="anchorfix"><h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>My name is George Kormaris and I am a Greek-born, 23-year-old web developer specializing in the front end of
        applications. In 2010 I entered the top CS school (highest entrance exam score
        requirement), in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
      </p>
      <p>In 2009, I became interested in Bitcoin and its implications to global trade and economy. I began trading full-
        time, and by 2012 I quit my studies to pursue trading as a career.
      </p>
      <p>In 2010, during my first semester in college, I also developed an interest in web development. I started by
        making
        websites for friends and later freelancing. This slowly turned into my primary passion, and in 2013 I ceased
        trading in order to take on more projects and start my own company. I then moved to London where I live with my
        sister.</p>

    <article id="skills" class="anchorfix"><h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
      <p>I am mainly proficient in frontend web development, which in this case encompasses UX design. Here's an
        overview of my skills:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript:
          <p>Building user interactions, implementing complex functionality and single page applications. Experience
            with
            jQuery and other popular libraries, Object Oriented Javascript (ES5) as well as familiarity with reactive
            programming principles. I prefer vanilla Javascript unless a framework or library is particularly suitable
            for the project at hand.</p>
        </li>
        <li>CSS:
          <p>Designing web applications from start to finish. I am familiar with Bootstrap and CSS pre-processors,
            however I have not used them in a project yet, as I have been handwriting styles from the ground up.</p>
        </li>
        <li>PHP (& WordPress):
          <p>Implementing backend operations and serving dynamic HTML. Most of my PHP experience is either in the
            context of WordPress or college assignments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Ubuntu & AWS:
          <p>Successfully operated Ubuntu servers in the Amazon cloud, serving thousands of pageviews per day without
            issues (mostly in a LAMP stack). However, sysadmining is far from my expertise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Dart:
          <p>Using Dart to build complex web applications, both in the front and back end. Due to its similarity to
            Java/C#, I found Dart easy to get started with, and eventually a very productive and sane way to develop in
            the web. (I sometimes talk about Dart almost to the point of proselytization.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>Git and various developer tools:
          <p>Familiarity with a variety of tools in the modern web developer toolchain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Photoshop & Adobe Suite:
          <p>11 years of photo editing and design both as a hobby as well as a professional occupation.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>I am currently unable to provide screenshots of my work, especially defunct websites. However, I have
          backups in my
          possession, and given a few days I will be able to spin them up and provide a full overview.</em>

      <h3 class="defunct">Entostopou.gr (2010, defunct)</h3>
      <span class="disclaimer">Joomla, PHP</span>
      <p>First public website. Using the Joomla CMS, I created this Greek news blog with the help of a fellow
        student. In the end, I spent more time looking for security holes in Joomla than updating the content.</p>
      <h3 class="defunct">Athenian.co (2011-2012, defunct)</h3>
      <span class="disclaimer">MyBB, PHP, CSS</span>
      <p>A gaming forum using the <a href="http://www.mybb.com/">MyBB forum software</a>. I created a theme that closely
        mimicked the vBulletin look and functionality. It was quite an exposure to PHP and CSS.</p>
      <h3 id="defunct">Best-Supplement.com</h3>
      <span class="disclaimer">WordPress, PHP, Javascript, CSS</span>
      <p>A nutritional supplement review website. The owner came to me with a Themeforest theme, which I modified
        extensively, made responsive and added a lot of extra functionality. Some of that is a PHP script to grab the
        prices from online supplement retailers (curl & XPath) and display them in a table. Hosted on Ubuntu EC2.</p>
      <h3 class="wip">Nutrisu.com</h3>
      <span class="disclaimer">Dart, CSS</span>
      <p>I have been working on this startup for the past year. It uses Dart on the front and back end.</p>

      <span class="disclaimer"><b>Chrome Extension (Javascript)</b></span>
      <p>A Chrome extension for reddit! As you might have noticed, navigating deep comment threads isn't easy. Many
        subreddits try to alleviate this by alternating comment box shades, adding left borders etc. I thought a line
        sewed through each comment would be more intuitive to quickly pinpoint the parent of a comment.</p>

      <p>Next level responsive web design: Position Responsive allows elemnts to be positioned depending on the
        viewport's position on the user's screen. It is extremely lightweight, capable of positioning hundreds of

      <span class="disclaimer"><b>Javascript Library in Dart (Can share code on request)</b></span>
      <p>A Dart-to-Javascript frontend framework. Overcoming many shortcomings of Dart (see getScript) and providing
        novel functionality for frontend developers.</p>
      <p>My personal page, gekorm.com is my playground for testing the functionality of Quasi.</p>

      <span class="disclaimer"><b>Dart Library</b></span>
      <p>Dart has promised Isolates (Workers) with DOM access for dynamic code loading for a while now with
        <em>spawnDomUri()</em>. This library delivers on the promise. Soon to use the Isolate API to act as a complete
        replacement.</p>

      <p>These two little games (CSS / Canvas) were made for a <em>reddit Inc.</em> job application. The position was "Creative
        Engineer" and they challenged applicants to do something interesting with their mascot, Snoo. I ended up not
        applying, but since I found this job ad in reddit, here it is.</p>

    <article id="interests" class="anchorfix"><h2>Other Interests</h2>
      <p>Coffee, bread making, skiing, obscure music, nutrition and trading. I like to talk about those a lot.</p>

    <article id="why-work-here" class="anchorfix"><h2>Why Work Here</h2>
      <p>I believe this could be a mutually beneficial relationship. To me, this is an opportunity to expand my
        knowledge and skillset by bringing ideas to fruition in cooperation with a larger team. This position would
        allow me to focus primarily on the frontend and the user experience.</p>
      <p>Other than personal growth, the company could benefit equally from my skills and eagerness to learn. I always
        struggle for the best result; lightweight solutions, maintainable code, optimized user interactions.</p>
